Hello! My name is Haotian, or Jack. I'm currently a 1st year PhD student at the University of Michigan advised by [Prof. Lin Ma](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~linmacse/) and [Prof. Barzan Mozafari](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mozafari/). I wasan undergraduate student studying CS at the University of British Columbia. At UBC, I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Margo Seltzer](https://www.seltzer.com/margo/) on building graph processing systems. I also had the honor to work with [Prof. Yiting Xia](https://sites.google.com/view/yitingxia) on investigating routing strategies for optical routers.

I am currently working on GPU acceleration for data systems. Our current vision is to bring **I/O awareness to query execution**. We hypothesize that I/O will be a critical contested resource, as frequent data transfers between host and device memory is required for data processing workloads. 

You can find my CV [Here](assets/files/Haotian_Gong_Resume.pdf). I'm always open to connect!
