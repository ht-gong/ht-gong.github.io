Hello! My name is Haotian, or Jack. I'm currently a 5th year undergraduate student studying CS at the University of British Columbia. At UBC, I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Margo Seltzer](https://www.seltzer.com/margo/) on building graph processing systems. I also had the honor to work with [Prof. Yiting Xia](https://sites.google.com/view/yitingxia) on investigating routing strategies for optical routers.

You can find my CV [Here](assets/files/Haotian_Gong_Resume.pdf). I'm open to internships and research opportunities for summer 2024!
