Hello! My name is Haotian, or Jack. I'm currently a 3rd year undergraduate student studying CS at the University of British Columbia. I plan to graduate in 2024.

You can find my CV [Here](assets/files/Haotian_Gong_Resume.pdf). I'm looking for internships and research opportunities for summer 2023!
